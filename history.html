            <h1>My work history </h1>
            <p align = "justify">Everyone has a story. Mine is a bit winding, but I've really learned a lot of things through it, as well as working in different environments and professions. 
              This experience made me fall in love with data analysis. With good data analysis, I hope to help and create solutions that help other people.This is why I decided to shape my career path in this direction. I believe that in addition to entertainment, technology can be used to help people and make everyday life easier.</p>
            <p align = "justify">Long story short: I learned how to code in Swift nad SQL. I am currently learning how to best use Excel and Power BI.
            Before that I tried some Python, JavaScript & Matlab. I work as a Data Analyst in Supply Chain department in Pepco and besides planning I'm also 
            preparing useful tools in Excel for other planners.</p>

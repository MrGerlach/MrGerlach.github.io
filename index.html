            <h2> Hello! My name is Micha≈Ç. I'm Swift enthusiast. </h2>
        <p>I've been coding in Swift since May 2022 and finished iOS Developer Career Path course by Codecademy in December 2022.
            Before that I tried some Python, JavaScript & Matlab. I work as a Demand Planner in Pepco and besides planning I'm also 
            preparing useful tools in Excel for other planners.</p>
